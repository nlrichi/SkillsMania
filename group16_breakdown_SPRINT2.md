What did everyone do in Sprint 1? Write below next to your name. If you were a scrum master,
add some brief details of what you did aswell

Raza Khalid : I have been the scrum master for the first week of sprint 2. I organised and co-ordinated the voting for the user stories that would be completed in the second sprint, reported all details to the supervisor in the meeting, organised the scrum boards as well as adding all the new user stories that have been voted on and assigining them weights based on importance. I have also talked to the supervisor regarding group members who are inactive and how to manage this in the future, as well as setting up a timetable for weekly group meetings.


Hammed Agboluaje: I have been the scrum master for the second week of sprint 2. As of the Wednesday meeting, I got updates on where everyone is at including **Raza** and I finishing our features. His feature is currently getting tested and integrated while mine is still waiting for his testing to finish and follow through. The other features are still in progress nearing completion and are being monitored carefully by all.
