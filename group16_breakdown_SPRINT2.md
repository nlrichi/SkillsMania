Raza Khalid : I have been the scrum master for the first week of sprint 2. I organised and co-ordinated the voting for the user stories that would be completed in the second sprint, reported all details to the supervisor in the meeting, organised the scrum boards as well as adding all the new user stories that have been voted on and assigining them weights based on importance. I have also talked to the supervisor regarding group members who are inactive and how to manage this in the future, as well as setting up a timetable for weekly group meetings.
