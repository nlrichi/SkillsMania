## SkillsMania : Documentation
**About SkillsMania**

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
SkillsMania is a Spring Boot Web Application, which gamifies elements of IBM SkillsBuild to create a more attractive and engaging learning environment. SkillsMania has not been officially deployed to a live domain as of yet, and is still going through iterations of development, hence there are some additional running instructions to get SkillsMania up and running on your machine.
</details>

**Running & Setting Up Requirements**

1. A stable internet connection
2. Any IDE which can run MVC Spring Applications. We will be including instructions for IntelliJ Idea (We will be using 2023.2.2, but recommend the latest version.) You cannot use the community edition, as it does not have the capability to run Spring Boot MVC Applications.
3. The installation of Git
4. Installation of MySQL with the succesful running of a local server (we recommed using MySQL Workbench 8.0CE and later versions )

**Running & Setting Up Instructions**

1. Open IntelliJ, or your relevant IDE. (Note the following instructions are applicable to IntelliJ).
2. Head to the top right corner, and perform the following operations

`Click : File > New > Project from Version Control > Repository URL > Version Control = Git`

3. You are now ready to clone the Gitlab Repository in which the main project is contained. Where URL is stated, paste the following link :

`https://campus.cs.le.ac.uk/gitlab/co2201-2024/group-16.git`

4. Now, locate the directory that the project that is about to be created in.

5. Great, now the project has been cloned! Now allow the project some time to build.

6. Configuring the database to ensure no errors : 

A) Open the project directory on the right hand side of IntelliJ, or where it is in your IDE. 

B) Open the **src > main > resources** folder. Locate the **application.properties** file. 

C) Now, either create a new local SQL Server with the **username : co2103**, **password : password** and **database name : co2103db**, or edit the following code in application properties with your server details : 

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/co2103db

spring.datasource.username=co2103

spring.datasource.password=password
```
7. Run the application & head to http://localhost:8080/ where hopefully you will see the SkillsMania landing page.

_**If the steps didn't go correctly or the programme is not running, below is some common issues with fixes.**_

------------------------------

**Troubleshooting for some common issues**

| Issue    | Possible Resolution |
| ------ | ------ |
|    Gradle fails to build    | The most common issue here is the Java SDK not being set to the project SDK, hence the Gradle fails to build. The project **SDK is 17**, adjust this in the project settings, download if needed, and this should work now.       |
|   Database errors showing in project build causing the crash of programme     |  Ensure **application.properties** details are correct as shown in the running/setting up instructions above for the database.      |
I cannot run the project, as the classes are showing as 'teacups' and the programme run icon is grayed out / unclickable. | There can be many reasons to this, and you might want to refer to your IDE Documentation for more in depth case by case details. Our developer team faced this a few times during the course of intial development, and our simple fix was to ensure the folder that is at the top of the root project directory is **java_mvc_base**, not a folder which contains java_mvc_base.

**The Progress Bar**

The progress bar has been created and positioned just underneath the main header menu on the application. The progress bar allows the user to have a visual reference of how much of the total courses they have completed.

- There are 5 courses available to complete in SkillsMania. The progress bar displays the percentage of how many courses have been completed.
- As there are 5 courses in total that can be completed, each course holds a weight of 20%.

A new user will start with 0% completion on the progress bar, and it will be completely grayed out, as they have not completed any courses yet. A succesful completion of a course will lead to the green incrementing of the progress bar on the dashboard once refreshed.

_If a user completes a single course 5 times, will they achieve 100% on the progress bar?_

- The progress bar will only increment based on the first attempt on a course a user has done. This has been done to prevent any misuse and also provides a better user experience. If a user completes one course for example, 5 times, the progress bar will only increment once.
- The progress bar has a maximum percentage of 100.
